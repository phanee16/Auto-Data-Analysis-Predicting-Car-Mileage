Created a binary variable, mpg01, indicating whether a car's mileage is above or below its median value, to facilitate prediction using the Auto dataset.
Explored the association between mpg01 and other features through scatterplots, boxplots, and correlation analysis to identify potential predictors.
Split the data into training and test sets, using half of the data for each, to evaluate the performance of different classification models.
Applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict mpg01 based on selected features.
Calculated the test error rates for each model and determined that Logistic Regression achieved the lowest error rate of 8.67%.
Conducted KNN with various values of K and identified the optimal value of K that resulted in the lowest test error rate of 11.22%.
